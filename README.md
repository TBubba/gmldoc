# GMLDoc

***The missing documentation tool for GameMaker Extensions.***

Generates documentation files in HTML format from a given GameMaker project. The tool allows implicit documentation simply
by adding comments to your scripts and objects. You can document your scripts as follows;

```
/// my_cool_script(arg0,arg1)
/// Simply adds the two arguments together.
/// @param arg0 The first argument to the function
/// @param arg1 The second argument to the function
/// @return An awesome value that you probably want to deal with

return argument0 + argument1
```

Each script has four components;

- **Usage** eg. my_cool_script(arg0,arg1)
- **Description** eg. Simply adds the two arguments together.
- **Parameters** in the format <name> <description> eg. arg0 The first argument to the function
- **Return Statement** eg. An awesome value that you probably want to deal with

You can comment any way you like, the tool will stop reading your comments once a break in
leading comment is found.

```
/*
** another_cool_script()
** I prefer stars in my docs
** @return Another value
*/

// This comment is ignored
return 5;
```

You can also use markup in your comments to give headings, bold text and code examples like so;

```
/// my_super_well_documented_function()
/// <p>This is an awesome function that doesn't do very much, but has 
/// awesome documentation.</p>
/// <p>We can add some extra spacing using line breaks and paragraph tags.<p>
///	</br>
/// <h5>Example</h5>
/// <p>Here is an example of how to use this function.</p>
/// <pre>
/// var greeting = my_super_well_documented_function();
/// show_debug_message(greeting);
/// </pre>
/// <b>This will be bold</b>

return "Hello World";
```

Documentation like this is useful because it easy to do and your users can simply look at your
scripts to get all the information that's available in the API reference. It's about not
having to make documentation a separate, pain-staking task, it should all just come together.

### Installation

You must have [python 2.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed to use this library. Follow the instructions on [python.org](https://www.python.org/) for installation on your specific platform.

Jinja2 must also be installed to use this library. Instructions on how to install it can be found on [jinja.pocoo.org](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/intro/).

I plan to add binaries for the library in the future, for now it should suffice to simply clone this repo.

The theme for the generated pages is written in [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). To modify the styles, you will need a SASS compiler. Once you have one, compile 'all.scss' to a single css file 'all.css'. Eg. If you are using [sassc](https://github.com/sass/sassc)

```
cd styles
sassc all.scss > all.css
```

### Usage

Command Line

```
python gmdoc.py /path/to/MyProject.gmx/MyProject.project.gmx
```

### TODO 

- Document extension constants
- Add type information to parameters and returns
- Document objects and their properties
- Allow additional docs through game information
