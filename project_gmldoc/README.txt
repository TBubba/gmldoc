This folder is optional and created for my personal convinience while debugging. I uploaded it because someone else might find it convinient as well.

The idea is that this folder should be copied into the project folder of any Game Maker project that uses GMLDOC. And then the batch files in this this folder could be run whenever you want to compile the documentation. This way the documentation will not overwrite other projects documentation, and the batch files are close and handy for each project.

Don't forget to properly set up the batch files for every folder, since not all paths are relative.

(I might make a batch file with a dialog that generates batch files to match entered paths etc.)
